## Requirements

Installation methods
1.	Via CDN
The easiest way to include StyleXui in your project is by using the CDN link. Simply add the following <link> tag to your HTML file:


`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.stylexui.com/@v1.0.0-stable/css/xui.css" />`

Optional JavaScript (for interactive components) 

`<script src="https://cdn.stylexui.com/@v1.0.0-stable/js/xui.js" defer></script>`

This method is ideal for:
●	Rapid prototyping
●	Simple HTML projects
●	Minimizing local file dependencies

2.	NPM/Yarn installation
For developers working with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, installing StyleXui via NPM or Yarn provides better version control and flexibility.

a.	Install via NPM

`npm install @richaadgigi/stylexui`

b.	Install via Yarn

`yarn add @richaadgigi/stylexui`

After installation, import StyleXui into your project:

  `import '@richaadgigi/stylexui/css/xui.min.css'`

  `import { apply } from '@richaadgigi/stylexui'`

  `apply()`

This approach is suitable for:
●	Component-based frameworks
●	Scalable projects with build tools
●	Managing dependencies effectively

3.	Manual download (ZIP files)
For offline use or when package managers are not an option, you can download the framework manually. 
a.	Download the latest version from the official [git](https://github.com/richaadgigi/stylexui.git). 
b.	Extract the files and link the CSS in your HTML file:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/xui.css" />`

Optional JavaScript (for interactive components)

`<script src="path/to/xui.js" defer></script>`

Manual installation works best for:
●	Static HTML/CSS projects
●	Legacy systems without modern tooling
●	Custom hosting needs
